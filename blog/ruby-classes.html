      <p>A class is made up of a collection of variables and acts as a blueprint from which individual objects are created. Class names start with an uppercase letter, while method names start with a lowercase letter (see example below).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <span class="position">
      class Movies<br><br>
        def initialize(movie_title, movie_time)<br>
           @movie_title = movie_title<br>
           @move_time = time<br>
        end<br><br>
        def announcement<br>
          puts "The next showing of #{@movie_title} <br>will be at {@movie_time}. Hurry and <br>get your ticket!"<br>
        end<br>
      end<br>
    </span>
    </section>

      <section>
      <p>initialize is a special method in Ruby programs and the first method we start with when working with classes. When you call Movies.new to create a new Movie object or instance, Ruby creates an uninitialized object and then calls that object's initialize method, passing in any parameters that were passed to new. This gives you a chance to write code that sets up your object's state/behavior.</p>
      </section>

     <section>
     <p>For class Movies, the initialize method takes two parameters. These parameters are local variables within the method, so they follow the local variable naming convention of starting with a lowercase letter.
    </p>
    </section>

      <section><p>Just a quick reminder about variables, Ruby provides 4 types:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Local Variables: Local variables are the variables that are defined in a method. Local variables are not available outside the method. They begin with a lowercase letter or _.</li>
          <li>Instance Variables: Instance variables are available across methods for any particular instance or object. That means that instance variables change from object to object. Instance variables are preceded by the at sign (@) followed by the variable name.</li>
          <li>Class Variables: Class variables are available across different objects. A class variable belongs to the class and is a characteristic of a class. They are preceded by the sign @@ and are followed by the variable name.</li>
          <li>Global Variables: Class variables are not available across classes. If you want to have a single variable, which is available across classes, you need to define a global variable. The global variables are always preceded by the dollar sign ($).</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
      <p>Going back to our example, the class Movies now has an established initialize method that accepts two parameters (movie_title and movie_time). We can also create another method that will allow us to announce the next showing of a movie. Each method in a class starts with the keyword def followed by the method name. As a best practice, the method name is typically lowercase and utilizes underscores (_) to separate words.
