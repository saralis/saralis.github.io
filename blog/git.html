        Have you ever worked on a project or wrote a paper and a some point something went wrong? Either information was deleted by accident, you had a change of heart on the wording or approached used previously and wished you could go back to how it used to be. Wouldn’t it be great if you could go back? This is where Version control would be mighty handy!
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of coding, version control keeps track of edits. It allows you to see when changes were made, why they were made and what content actually changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let’s now take a look at Git and GitHub - Git is a version control system utilized locally (on your computer) when installed on your Command Line Interface. GitHub utilizes the Git version control system remotely/on the internet. Both allow for multiple edits simultaneously and merges the changes once committed* so that there is one main document being worked on at all times. GitHub requires uploads from the work being done locally on your computer and tracks the edits made but multiple individuals. GitHub helps with Version control when collaborating. Multiple individuals can work on the same material at the same time and, once uploaded, GitHub merges the edits into the one version being worked on.

        As you continue to learn and practice code, remember that version control is your friend. There for your to make things a little easier.

        *A commit is done to save your work when comfortable with the progress. Commit allows you to save bundles of changes at a time as you move along the work/project.
