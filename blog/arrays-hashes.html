      <h3>What is an array? What is a hash?</h3>
      <p><span class="welcome">Hashes and arrays</span> both store data. In an array, the slots are lined up in a row, and each one is numbered (starting from zero). Ex: </p>
      <p>Syntax<br><br>

        # Array literal notation<br>
        variable = [item1, item2, ..., itemN]<br><br>

        Example<br><br>
        seasons = ['winter', 'spring', 'summer', 'fall']</p>

      <p>In a hash, the slots are not in a row (they are just thrown in together), and you can use any object to refer to a slot, not just a number. Ex:  </p>
      <p>Syntax<br><br>

        # Hash literal notation<br><br>
        hash_ex = {<br>
          key1: value1,<br>
          key2: value2<br>
          }<br>
        <br>
        Example<br><br>
        hash_pets = {<br>
          name: "Bob",<br>
          age:  91<br>
          }<br>
          => { :name => "Artur", :age => 21}
        </p>

      <h3>When do we use arrays and hashes?</h3>
      <p>Arrays are best used when you are working with an ordered list of items. Every slot in the list acts like a variable: you can see what object a particular slot points to, and you can make it point to a different object. You can make an array by using square brackets [] In Ruby, As mentioned earlier, the first value in an array has index 0.</p>

      <p>It is good to use hashes when you have a bunch of things you want to keep track of but they do note really fit into an ordered list. You can make an array by using brackets {}. </p>
