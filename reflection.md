**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned that these elements can add a great deal to the asthetics of a site, particularly if you are dealing with bottons/nav bars etc. For the most part, these elements were pretty easy to use.


**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned how critical it is to use the appropriate value. In my first few attempts of combining position, display, margin etc. I had text over lapping text and in spaces I didn't want it to be. I learned the right positioning (especially if element positions should be similar across html pages) are extremely helpful to have in your CSS file to be implemented on subsites.


**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

Adding the images and styleing the links were the easiest to implement given the practice we've had at this point. The most difficult part was utilizing position and display in CSS. I had a difficult time figuring out what methods were best to use for what I wanted to achieve.



**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned to really pay attention to the elements used as you start to add more and more CSS and html elements things can get a bit confusing. I learned the importance of formatting using elements in a smart and efficient way so it's easier to follow when you review it.
