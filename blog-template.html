How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was great to working with a pair to discuss initial thoughts. We had the change to mention something things we liked about blogs we've seen in the past. I found it got the wheels turning in my head of layouts that continued even after we completed the session. The collaborator tool was great to also build out the HTML foundation for the page.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, thinking about layout also brings up questions of content and it's importance. I found myself have an idea but then scrapping it when thinking about how this would be built out in html. I ask myself 'is this truly valuable?' If the answer is 'no' it doesn't seem worth it to include.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We discussed navigation to the index and other blog posts as an important aspect of the wireframe. Also including an about me to communicate who are you in the site. We also discussed how the content should be placed visually (ie: all left, all centered)

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
Working with my pair, I tried out centering text for the first time and also researched adding a search bar (decided not to include though).
